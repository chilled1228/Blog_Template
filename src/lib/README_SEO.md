# SEO Improvements with Slug System

This document explains the SEO improvements implemented in the blog through the use of slugs.

## Slug System

We've implemented a slug system for blog posts to improve SEO. Slugs are URL-friendly versions of the post titles that:

1. Are lowercase
2. Contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores
3. Are unique for each post
4. Provide descriptive URLs that help search engines understand the content

### Benefits of Using Slugs

1. **Better SEO**: Search engines prefer descriptive URLs that contain keywords related to the content.
2. **Improved User Experience**: Users can understand what a page is about just by looking at the URL.
3. **Permalinks**: Slugs provide stable URLs that won't change even if the title is updated.
4. **Social Sharing**: Cleaner URLs look better when shared on social media.

### How Slugs Are Generated

Slugs are generated from the post title using the following process:

1. Convert to lowercase
2. Remove special characters
3. Replace spaces with hyphens
4. Ensure uniqueness

### Example

| Title | Slug |
|-------|------|
| How to create better visuals with less prompting | how-to-create-better-visuals-with-less-prompting |

## Implementation Details

1. **Database**: The `blog_posts` table includes a `slug` column that stores the slug for each post.
2. **Routing**: Blog post URLs use the slug instead of the ID: `/blog/[slug]`
3. **API**: The API endpoints support fetching posts by slug for better integration.
4. **Components**: The BlogPostCard component uses slugs for links.

## Best Practices

1. Keep slugs short but descriptive
2. Avoid stop words (the, and, or) when possible
3. Use hyphens instead of underscores (Google treats hyphens as word separators)
4. Don't change slugs after publication to maintain SEO rankings
