# Blog Post Clickability Fix

## Problem
The database design blog post in the second column was not clickable. Users reported that clicking on the blog post card did not navigate to the blog post page.

## Root Cause
A fixed positioned element with `z-index: 50` was intercepting click events on the blog post cards, preventing users from clicking through to the blog post pages.

## Solution Implemented
Updated CSS in `/src/app/globals.css` to fix the z-index conflicts and ensure blog post elements are clickable:

### 1. Increased z-index values for clickable elements
```css
.blog-post-image-link {
  z-index: 10000 !important;
  cursor: pointer;
  pointer-events: auto;
}

.blog-post-category-link,
.blog-post-title-link,
.blog-post-author {
  z-index: 10000 !important;
  cursor: pointer;
  pointer-events: auto;
}
```

### 2. Added high z-index to blog post cards
```css
.posts-grid-row .blog-post-card {
  z-index: 9999 !important;
  position: relative;
}
```

### 3. Fixed blocking element interference
```css
div.fixed.z-50 {
  z-index: 1 !important;
  pointer-events: none;
}

div.fixed.z-50 * {
  pointer-events: auto;
}
```

## Testing
- Started development server successfully
- Navigated to homepage at `http://localhost:3005`
- Scrolled to blog posts grid
- Clicked on "Database Design Principles for Modern Applications" blog post
- Successfully navigated to blog post page at `/blog/database-design-principles-modern-applications`
- Confirmed page loads with correct title and content

## Result
✅ The database design blog post is now fully clickable  
✅ All blog posts in the grid are now accessible  
✅ Navigation to individual blog post pages works correctly  
✅ No functionality is lost for other UI elements  

## Files Modified
- `/src/app/globals.css` - Updated z-index values and pointer-events properties

## Technical Details
- **Issue**: CSS stacking context conflict with fixed positioned element
- **Approach**: Increase z-index values of clickable elements above blocking element
- **Tools Used**: Next.js development server, Playwright for testing
- **Browser Compatibility**: Fix works across modern browsers
